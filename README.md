# HiDream Implementation Progress

## TODO
- [ ] Fix tensor naming mismatch in TimestepEmbed structure
- [ ] Implement proper model loading with correct tensor paths
- [ ] Add support for multiple text encoders (CLIP, T5, LLaMA)
- [ ] Implement proper VAE integration for image encoding/decoding
- [ ] Add scheduler integration for denoising process
- [ ] Fix HDModel forward method to match expected inputs
- [ ] Add proper image conditioning support for E1 models
- [ ] Implement complete generation pipeline
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Test with actual model files

## Doing
- Analyzing tensor structure in safetensors files to fix naming mismatches
- Implementing proper model forward pass

## Done
- Initial HiDream model structure created
- Basic attention and MoE implementations added
- Helper functions implemented
- Fixed compilation errors - code now compiles successfully
- Created working main.rs that loads text encoders and model files
- Implemented basic pipeline structure
